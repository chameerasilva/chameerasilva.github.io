excerpt: "Teaching scientific software development does not have to happen in front of a screen.<br>"

I teach courses and workshops on topics such as geodynamics, numerical modeling, scientific software development, and software community management. I have given tutorials with 5 to 100 participants for local research groups, graduate summer schools, national workshops and international scientific conferences. Please see below for a selection of my teaching engagements.
