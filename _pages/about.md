About me
======


Research
--------

I am a PhD student in computational geodynamics, developing computer models to study how Earth and other planets deform through time. My dissertation research focuses on continental rifting, a fundamental process that shapes continents, creates new ocean basins, and influences Earthâ€™s long-term evolution. Using the open-source ASPECT code and high-performance computing, I build numerical models to explore how temporal variations in plate boundary forces and thermal mantle plumes control the initiation, evolution, and ultimate outcome of rifting.

Beyond my dissertation, I am broadly interested in improving the accuracy and reliability of geodynamic modeling by advancing numerical methods and best practices for scientific software. My work bridges geophysics, geology, and computational science, with the goal of better capturing the physical processes that govern rock deformation and using these insights to understand both Earth and other planetary bodies.

<!-- I am a PhD student in computational geodynamics, developing computer models to study how Earth and other planets deform through time. My dissertation research focuses on continental rifting, a fundamental process that breaks apart continents, initiates new ocean basins, and influences the long-term evolution of our planet. I use numerical models to investigate how temporal variations in plate boundary forces and the presence of thermal mantle plumes shape the initiation, progression, and ultimate outcome of rifting. Through this work, I aim to improve our understanding of why some rifts succeed in forming new oceans while others fail, and what this tells us about the dynamic nature of Earth and other rocky planets. -->

<!-- Software
--------

I am a software developer and one of the principal developers and maintainers of the geodynamic modeling software [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) (Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics). I also contribute as a maintainer to the open-source finite-element framework [deal.II](https://dealii.org). I contribute to a number of different [software projects](https://gassmoeller.github.io/software/) and act as a reviewer for scientific software for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) and other journals. I was selected as one of the 2019 [Better Scientific Software fellows](https://bssw.io/) by the IDEAS team of the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project and together with my co-developers was awarded the 2025 SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering for our work on the deal.II library. -->
