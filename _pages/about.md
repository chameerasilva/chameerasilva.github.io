About me
======


Research
--------

I am a computational geodynamicist and work on understanding our Earth and other planets by developing computer models that describe their deformation history through time. Specifically, I focus on the accuracy and reliability of the mathematical methods and software implementations that scientists use to create these models, and on implementing better models for the physical processes that occur in rocks on Earth. I have published articles on the interaction between mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges, the influence of an evolving mineral grain size on the deformation in Earth's mantle, the efficiency and accuracy of numerical methods, equations that better capture physical behavior, and best practices for developing scientific software.


<!-- Software
--------

I am a software developer and one of the principal developers and maintainers of the geodynamic modeling software [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) (Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics). I also contribute as a maintainer to the open-source finite-element framework [deal.II](https://dealii.org). I contribute to a number of different [software projects](https://gassmoeller.github.io/software/) and act as a reviewer for scientific software for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) and other journals. I was selected as one of the 2019 [Better Scientific Software fellows](https://bssw.io/) by the IDEAS team of the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project and together with my co-developers was awarded the 2025 SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering for our work on the deal.II library. -->
