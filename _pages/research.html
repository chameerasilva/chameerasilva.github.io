    title: "Response of Continental Rift to Variation in Boundary Forces"
    excerpt: "In this project,we investigated how temporally varying driving forces—such as those arising from changes in slab dynamics—affect rift evolution 
    using numerical and semi-analytical models.
    
    Our results show that the timing, duration, and magnitude of boundary traction reductions strongly influence rift behavior. Later initiation of traction
    reduction and slower rates of reduction tend to promote successful continental breakup. Even a 25% decrease in boundary traction can lead to breakup 
    under favorable conditions, while a 50% reduction often results in failed rifts. Interestingly, extension velocities do not always evolve monotonically; 
    temporary accelerations can occur during force reduction, reflecting the dynamic nature of force balance. As shown in (b) both rift acceleration (R-A) and rif failure (R-F) could occur during
    force reduction (75%) period.

    These findings highlight that a rift can accelerate toward breakup even during periods of slow extension, demonstrating that variations in driving forces 
    play a critical role in determining whether continental rifting succeeds or fails. Manuscript is accepted in Scientific Reports"

    title: "Other Projects"
    excerpt: "I work on a wide range of topics that can be addressed with geodynamic modeling techniques, 
    using the [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) software. 
    This includes: Numerical methods for lithosphere dynamics and mantle convection, 
    the interactions between mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges, 
    the role of mineral grain size in mantle dynamics,
    accurately modeling mantle phase transitions,
    the accuracy and scalability of particle methods in geodynamic models,
    and how global mantle flow and subducting slabs influence the location and properties of mantle plumes."
