    title: "Integrated Geodynamic Earth Models"
    excerpt: "Im am part of a group of researchers working on the 
    [Development and Application of a Framework for Integrated Geodynamic Earth Models](https://integrated-earth.github.io/). 
    Our goal is to create three-dimensional, integrated geodynamic reference models for the Earth above the core-mantle boundary, 
    that can then be used for the accurate forward simulation of the Earth state on time scales of millions of years.
    Constraining the Earth's present-day state heavily relies on seismic observations, and 
    I am particularly interested in how we can use our knowledge about the Earth's variable mineral grain size to infer the 
    temperature distribution in the Earth's interior from these observations."

    excerpt: "I work on a wide range of topics that can be addressed with geodynamic modeling techniques, 
    using the [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) software. 
    This inlcudes: Numerical methods for magma/mantle dynamics and mantle compressiblity, 
    the formation of melt bands in partially molten rocks, 
    the role of mineral grain size in mantle dynamics,
    accurately modeling mantle phase transitions,
    the thermodiffusion of iron isotopes at the core-mantle boundary, 
    and how global mantle flow and subducting slabs influence the locations of mantle plumes."

I wrote my <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3516432">PhD Thesis</a>
on the interaction of subducted slabs and plume generation zones in geodynamic models.
