All geoscientific disciplines rely heavily on data acquisition and data processing, which by now is done almost exclusively digitally. Additionally, modeling as a supporting tool is becoming more complex and there is significant concern about the quality of scientific data processing and software (caused by many and high-profile retractions). This course teaches the basic discipline independent skills to follow best practices for storing, processing, publishing and archiving geoscientific data. Additionally, it discusses recommended practices for the use of existing or self-written geoscientific software and scripts. All material can be applied to work in other courses and the participant's research projects and will be practiced hands-on during the course. 

A basic understanding of handling files and directories on a computer is required, all further techniques will be taught in class. Experience with any programming language (e.g. Python, Matlab, R, C) will be helpful, but is not required.

Questions to be discussed:

Data:
- Why is reliable data so important? What is the difference between authored text (journal articles) and modern research data?
- What data needs to be archived? What about preliminary data? What is metadata and how to store it?
- Which tools, workflows and processes should be used to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible (FAIR)?
- What are requirements and expectations for publishable research data from journals and funding agencies?

Software:

- Why never trust an untested script? What is a good test? What is a benchmark?
- What are best software practices for coursework and research? Why always use version control, documentation, and tests? How to do this without slowing down work?
- How to store texts, articles, coursework without the need for versioned copies using version control systems? How to collaborate on texts without sending around dozens of copies?
- What is the difference between guessing correctness, verifying a software, and validating software output?
- How to publish the software related to a thesis or paper?
